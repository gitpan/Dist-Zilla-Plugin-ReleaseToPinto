DESCRIPTION
    "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReleaseToPinto" is a release-stage plugin that
    will ship your distribution to a local or remote Pinto repository.

CONFIGURATION
    The following parameters can be set in the dist.ini file for your
    distribution:

    repos = REPOSITORY
        This identifies the Pinto repository you want to release to. If
        "REPOSITORY" looks like a URL (i.e. starts with "http://") then your
        distribution will be shipped with Pinto::Remote. Otherwise, the
        "REPOSITORY" is assumed to be a path to a local repository
        directory. In that case, your distribution will be shipped with
        Pinto.

        NOTE: You'll need to install Pinto, or Pinto::Remote, or both,
        depending on what kind of repositories you're going to release to.
        Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReleaseToPinto does not explicitly depend on
        either of these modules, so you can decide which one you want
        without being forced to have a bunch of other modules.

    author = NAME
        This specifies your identity as a module author. It must be
        alphanumeric characters (no spaces) and will be forced to UPPERCASE.
        If you do not specify one, it defaults to either your PAUSE ID (if
        you have one configured elsewhere) or your current username.
